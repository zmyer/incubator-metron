# Monit Integration

This role will leverage Monit as a process watchdog to manage sensors, topologies, and core services.  

* Monit can be used to start, stop, or check status of any of the sensors or topologies.  
* When monitoring is enabled (on by default) if a process dies, it will be restarted.
* The Monit web interface is exposed at http://hostname:2812.
* The web interface username and password is defined by the `monit_user` and `monit_password` variables.  These default to `admin`/`monit`.
* Monit CLI tools can also be used to simplify the process of managing Metron components.
* The post-deployment report for Amazon-EC2 provides links to Monit's web interface labeled as 'Sensor Status' and 'Topology Status.'
